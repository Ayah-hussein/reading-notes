# Markdown
 is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.

**Markdown** is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as **bold** or *italic*, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

### Headings
To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.

### Styling text

| **Style**      | **Syntax**         | **Keyboard shortcut**    | **Example**     | **Output** |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------ |
| Bold       | ** ** or __ __ | command/control + b    | **This is bold text**      | This is bold text       |
| Italic   | * * or _ _     | command/control + i    | *This text is italicized*  | This text is italicized |
| Strikethrough          | ~~ ~~  |        | ~~This was mistaken text~~             | This was mistaken text           |
| Bold and nested italic | ** ** and _ _  |  | **This text is _extremely_ important** | This text is extremely important |
| All bold and italic    | \*** \***        |  |***All this text is important***       | All this text is important       |

### Quoting text
You can quote text with a >.

### Quoting code
You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks.

To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.

### Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link.

### Lists
You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or *.

To order your list, precede each line with a number.

### Task lists
To create a task list, preface list items with a regular space character followed by [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x].

### Mentioning people and teams
You can mention a person or team on GitHub by typing @ plus their username or team name.

### Paragraphs
You can create a new paragraph by leaving a blank line between lines of text.

### Ignoring Markdown formatting
You can tell GitHub to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using \ before the Markdown character.

### to insert an image:
Format: ![](url)

### Tables
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |
