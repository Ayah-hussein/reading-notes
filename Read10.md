# What Is Debugging?
No matter how much experience you have, the JavaScript code that you’re writing may contain an error. If not syntactical, there’s a high chance that you’ll get a logical error in case of a complex app.

A frustrating thing is that often you won’t get an error message or any clue about where the error is happening. Debugging is the technique of searching for and fixing these unknown errors.

Debugging is done by forcing the code to stop running at a certain line. You can do that by setting a breakpoint. Once the code is paused, you can inspect and find out what’s wrong with the code. Wondering how to debug in the case of a JavaScript code? We’ll find out in the next section.
