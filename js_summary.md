language can be used to tell browsers what you want them to do.

A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal.

WRITING A SCRIPT
To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it.

Start with the big picture of what
you want to achieve, and break
that down into smaller steps:
*1.* DEFINE THE GOAL
*2.* DESIGN THE SCRIPT
*3.* CODE EACH STEP

summary:
- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
- Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
- Expressions evaluate into a single value.
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
