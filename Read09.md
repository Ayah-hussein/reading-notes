# JS EVENTS

***What is an Event ?***
JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page.

When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window, resizing a window, etc.

In the case of the Web, events are fired inside the browser window, and tend to be attached to a specific item that resides in it â€” this might be a single element, set of elements, the HTML document loaded in the current tab, or the entire browser window. There are many different types of events that can occur. For example:

- The user selects a certain element or hovers the cursor over a certain element.
- The user chooses a key on the keyboard.
- The user resizes or closes the browser window.
- A web page finishes loading.
- A form is submitted.
- A video is played, paused, or finishes.
- An error occurs.


| **Event**   |                  **Description**                   |
| ----------- | :------------------------------------------------: |
|             |                                                    |
| onchange    |          An HTML element has been changed          |
| onclick     |          The user clicks an HTML element           |
| onmouseover |   The user moves the mouse over an HTML element    |
| onmouseout  | The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element |
| onkeydown   |           The user pushes a keyboard key           |
| onload      |     The browser has finished loading the page      |
